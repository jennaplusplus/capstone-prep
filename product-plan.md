Alexa Recipes is an Amazon Echo voice skill and accompanying web app. Users can browse recipes online and save them to access on their Amazon Echo device. Then they can interact with Alexa via voice to work their way through the recipe step by step.

## Problem Statement ##
Many people use laptops, phones, or other screened devices to reference recipes while cooking. However, it can be inconvenient to constantly unlock these devices and to interact with them with full or messy hands in the kitchen. My capstone will provide one solution to this problem by allowing users to interact with their chosen recipes via voice.

## Market Research ##
Currently, there are a handful of recipe-related apps currently available as Alexa Skills (searchable in the Alexa companion app). For instance, the *Bartender* skill allows you to ask for cocktail recipes, and the app will read the ingredients and a list of steps. However, there is no way to enter your own recipes, and there is also no way to hear the steps one by one. The *CookBook* skill currently available suffers from the same flaws. Finally, the *Campbell's Soup* skill offers recipes, but when a user requests a recipe, the user simply gets an email with the recipe included.

## User Personas ##
**The just-needs-reminders person**: This user is quite familiar with the given recipe. Perhaps they frequently make a particular salad dressing or marinade, and they just need small reminders about ingredient quantities, e.g., *"How much salt do I need?"*.  
**The messy, absent-minded cook**: This user needs to frequently reference a recipe, but they are often doing so while in the midst of cooking. They need a way to ask what to do next while their hands are already full, e.g., *"What's the next step?"*  
**The inexperienced junior chef**: This user is tech-savvy but not kitchen-savvy. Perhaps they're trying to surprise Mom or Dad with a simple recipe, but they need help getting through it. Anxious about messing up, this user always wants to know what's coming up, e.g., *"Preview the next 2 steps."*
